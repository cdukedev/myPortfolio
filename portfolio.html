        <h1>Importance of a Portfolio and necessary aspects to help to find Job placement.</h1>
        <p>
            The first step to make my portfolio to start to stand out will be to really clean up the code, pages and
            overall design including the responsiveness with media queries and testing on all browsers and devices that
            I have access to. Next I will be adding Javascript and Animations for smooth transitions and overall flow.
            For the projects section I would like the add react objects to show proficiency during the BootCamp I am
            attending over the summer. I will also add to the projects section and with more industry related projects
            that show more knowledge of api's, working with databases, using React, and the MERN stack to build more
            completed and functional web applications. I will also like to keep a blog section that I can link to while
            I am doing the 100 days of coding challenge on twitter this summer.
        </p>
        <p>
            Another area I would like to keep in my portfolio is a section for the civic projects that I plan to begin
            contributing to. As well as my experience while volunteering with the Microsoft Teal program if I am
            accepted into a school during the 2022-2023 school year. I will also be applying to lead a web development
            team at UPE in FIU in the fall, and would like to add this the the projects section.
        </p>

        <h2>Self Reflection on Portfolio Project</h2>
        <p>With this project I was able to dig in alot more with building out a figma project and creating a more
            detailed design rather than using it only for individual elements. It was interesting to take a page with
            built in components in Figma and transfer them over to HTML and CSS. My goal was to emulate a similar
            scenario to what a web developer would typically be presented with by having the full design laid out before
            beginning to work on the HTML. Another main focus of mine was to really to focus more on the accessability
            aspect of the app. It is important to me that anyone could use it and find value.
        </p>
        <p>When going through the testing I found one interesting scenario that I had not yet considered. I deployed my
            portfolio on github in a seperate repo with out the readMe file or any other affiliation with this course.
            When I opened the application on my wife's phone. The pages were all translated to french. Which
            significantly impacted the design since some of the words were much larger than the english translation and
            did not fit within the original container. So in the future I would like to test out specifically
            spanish,french and the other top Languages that are common to the majority of users.</p>
